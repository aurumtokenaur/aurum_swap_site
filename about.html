      <h1>🌟 About Aurum Token (AUR)</h1>
      <p>
        Gold has always been a symbol of value, stability, and trust. For centuries, nations and civilizations measured their wealth by the amount of gold they possessed. Even today, central banks around the world rely on gold as the foundation of their reserves.
      </p>
      <p>
        But physical gold has limits. It is difficult to transfer, divide, and make accessible for everyone. This is where <b>Aurum Token (AUR)</b> comes in: a digital asset inspired by the timeless strength of gold, but designed for the modern, decentralized global economy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aurum Token is not just a coin — it is a vision for the future:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>🌍 <b>Global Accessibility</b>: Bringing the value of gold to anyone, anywhere, through blockchain technology.</li>
        <li>💎 <b>Durability & Growth</b>: Just like gold holds value for generations, AUR is designed to grow with a sustainable ecosystem — staking, swaps, and long-term rewards for the community.</li>
        <li>🤝 <b>Equality & Inclusion</b>: Creating opportunities for people traditionally excluded from financial growth by offering tools to learn, save, and prosper.</li>
        <li>🎓 <b>Social Impact</b>: Over time, Aurum aims to support education and essential resources in countries whose natural wealth — including gold — was historically extracted without benefiting their people.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Aurum Token is not only about profit. It is about building a community, a culture, and a shared future where digital gold empowers people worldwide.
      </p>
